      summary: "We 1) present the first rigorous security, performance, energy, and cost analyses of the state-of-the-art on-DRAM-die read disturbance mitigation method, Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) and 2) propose Chronus, a new mechanism that addresses PRAC's two major weaknesses. Our analysis shows that PRAC's system performance overhead on benign applications is non-negligible for modern DRAM chips and prohibitively large for future DRAM chips that are more vulnerable to read disturbance. We identify two weaknesses of PRAC that cause these overheads. First, PRAC increases critical DRAM access latency parameters due to the additional time required to increment activation counters. Second, PRAC performs a constant number of preventive refreshes at a time, making it vulnerable to an adversarial access pattern, known as the wave attack, and consequently requiring it to be configured for significantly smaller activation thresholds. To address PRAC's two weaknesses, we propose a new on-DRAM-die RowHammer mitigation mechanism, Chronus. Chronus 1) updates row activation counters concurrently while serving accesses by separating counters from the data and 2) prevents the wave attack by dynamically controlling the number of preventive refreshes performed. Our performance analysis shows that Chronus's system performance overhead is near-zero for modern DRAM chips and very low for future DRAM chips. Chronus outperforms three variants of PRAC and three other state-of-the-art read disturbance solutions. We discuss Chronus's and PRAC's implications for future systems and foreshadow future research directions. To aid future research, we open-source our Chronus implementation and the tools we develop to analyze PRAC.",

      summary: " In this paper, our goal is to mitigate RowHammer at low cost by understanding the impact of reduced preventive refresh latency on RowHammer. To this end, we present the first rigorous experimental study on the interactions between refresh latency and RowHammer characteristics in real DRAM chips. Our experimental characterization using 388 real DDR4 DRAM chips from three major manufacturers demonstrates that a preventive refresh latency can be significantly reduced (by 64%). To investigate the impact of reduced preventive refresh latency on system performance and energy efficiency, we reduce the preventive refresh latency and adjust the aggressiveness of existing RowHammer solutions by developing a new mechanism, Partial Charge Restoration for Aggressive Mitigation (PaCRAM). Our results show that PaCRAM reduces the performance and energy overheads induced by five state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms with small additional area overhead. Thus, PaCRAM introduces a novel perspective into addressing RowHammer vulnerability at low cost by leveraging our experimental observations. To aid future research, we open-source our PaCRAM implementation.",

      summary: "In this work, we tackle the performance overheads of RowHammer solutions by tracking and throttling the generators of memory accesses that trigger RowHammer solutions. To this end, we propose BreakHammer. BreakHammer 1) observes the time-consuming RowHammer-preventive actions of existing RowHammer mitigation mechanisms, 2) identifies hardware threads that trigger many of these actions, and 3) reduces the memory bandwidth usage of each identified thread. As such, BreakHammer significantly reduces the number of RowHammer-preventive actions performed, thereby improving 1) system performance and DRAM energy, and 2) reducing the maximum slowdown induced on a benign application, with near-zero area overhead. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that BreakHammer effectively reduces the negative performance, energy, and fairness effects of eight RowHammer mitigation mechanisms. To foster further research we open-source our BreakHammer implementation and scripts",

      summary:`
      We tackle the performance overhead of existing read disturbance solutions by leveraging the spatial variation in read disturbance
      across different memory locations in real DRAM chips. To do so, we 1) present the first rigorous real DRAM chip characterization 
      study of spatial variation of read disturbance and 2) propose Svärd, a new mechanism that dynamically adapts the aggressiveness 
      of existing solutions based on the row-level read disturbance profile. Our experimental characterization on 144 real DDR4 DRAM chips 
      representing 10 chip designs demonstrates a large variation in read disturbance vulnerability across different memory locations: 
      in the part of memory with the worst read disturbance vulnerability, 1) up to 2x the number of bitflips can occur and 2) bitflips 
      can occur at an order of magnitude fewer accesses, compared to the memory locations with the least vulnerability to read disturbance. 
      Svärd leverages this variation to reduce the overheads of five state-of-the-art read disturbance solutions, 
      and thus significantly increases system performance.

      summary:`
      We propose a new operation, Hidden Row Activation (HiRA), and the HiRA Memory Controller (HiRA-MC) to
      perform HiRA operations.
      HiRA hides a refresh operation's latency by refreshing a
      row concurrently with accessing or refreshing another row
      within the same bank. Unlike prior works, HiRA achieves this
      parallelism without any modifications to off-the-shelf DRAM
      chips. To do so, it leverages the new observation that two
      rows in the same bank can be activated without data loss if the
      rows are connected to different charge restoration circuitry. 

      HiRA reduces the time spent on refresh operations by 51.4%. 
      HiRA-MC increases system performance by 12.6% and 3.73× as it reduces the performance degradation due to periodic refreshes 
      and refreshes for RowHammer protection (preventive refreshes), respectively, for future DRAM chips with increased density and 
      RowHammer vulnerability.

      This is the first work to experimentally demonstrate on 272
      real DRAM chips that lowering VPP reduces a DRAM chip's
      RowHammer vulnerability. We show that lowering VPP 1) increases the number of activate-precharge cycles needed to induce a RowHammer bit flip by up to 85.8 % with an average of
      7.4 % across all tested chips and 2) decreases the RowHammer
      bit error rate by up to 66.9 % with an average of 15.2 % across
      all tested chips. At the same time, reducing VPP marginally
      worsens a DRAM cell's access latency, charge restoration, and
      data retention time within the guardbands of system-level nominal timing parameters for 208 out of 272 tested chips. We
      conclude that reducing VPP is a promising strategy for reducing
      a DRAM chip's RowHammer vulnerability without requiring

      summary:`
        We present an experimental characterization using 248 DDR4
        and 24 DDR3 modern DRAM chips from four major DRAM manufacturers demonstrating how the RowHammer effects vary with
        three fundamental properties: 1) DRAM chip temperature, 2) aggressor row active time, and 3) victim DRAM cell's physical location.
        Among our 16 new observations, we highlight that a RowHammer
        bit flip 1) is very likely to occur in a bounded range, specific to each
        DRAM cell (e.g., 5.4% of the vulnerable DRAM cells exhibit errors
        in the range 70 °C to 90 °C), 2) is more likely to occur if the aggressor row is active for longer time (e.g., RowHammer vulnerability
        increases by 36% if we keep a DRAM row active for 15 column
        accesses), and 3) is more likely to occur in certain physical regions
        of the DRAM module under attack (e.g., 5% of the rows are 2x more
        vulnerable than the remaining 95% of the rows). Our study has
        important practical implications on future RowHammer attacks
        and defenses. We describe and analyze the implications of our new
        findings by proposing three future RowHammer attack and six
        future RowHammer defense improvements.

      summary:`
      We mathematically demonstrate that Silver Bullet, when properly configured and implemented in a DRAM chip, can securely prevent RowHammer attacks. The demonstration focuses on the most representative implementation of Silver Bullet, the patent claiming many implementation possibilities not covered in this demonstration. Our study concludes that Silver Bullet is a promising RowHammer prevention mechanism that can be configured to operate securely against RowHammer attacks at various efficiency-area tradeoff points, supporting relatively small hammer count values (e.g., 1000) and Silver Bullet table sizes (e.g., 1.06KB).
